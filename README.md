In this project, I am analyzing data to communicate useful insights about a fantasy games called Heroes of Pymoli. The dataset contains various purchasing data, such as the age and gender of buyers, among others. It can be accessed at [purchase_data.csv](Resources/purchase_data.csv). 

Using Jupyter Notebook, below is a summary of the steps to analyze the dataset:

### 1. Reading and Storing the dataset into a Dataframe

### 2. Doing a statistical analysis of the dataset.

### 3. Player Count
Finding a unique count of Players as some players had more than 1 purchase.

  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

### Top Spenders

* Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * SN

As final considerations:

* You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
